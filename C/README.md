# Implementation of LRU Cache in C

IMPLEMENTATION IS COMPLETE AND TESTED FOR FUNCTIONALITY.

* Clear and well documented code.
* Easy less dependency support.
* O(1) time operations.

## File structure : 
 * dll_test.c - Is the informal functionality tests of the DLL(double linked list). 
 * hash.h - Is the implementation of a hash table, ported from an implementation found on GitHub.
 * linkedList.h - Is the implementation of the DLL with all necessary functions for the LRU Cache.
 * lru.c - Is the implementation of the LRU Cache (probably must be .h) with all its functions.
 * lru_test - Is the an informal functionality test of the LRU Cache.
