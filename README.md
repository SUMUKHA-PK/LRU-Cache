# Implementations of LRU Cache

LRU - Least Recently Used. 

* Completion checklist :
 - [x] C
 - [ ] C++
 - [x] Go 
 - [ ] JAVA (In progress)
 
* C implementation is complete and checked with the LRU Cache problem on Leetcode. 
(C implementation was done in order to re-familirise myself with C and to "go back to the basics")

* Implementation in C++ will be very similar to the C++ implementations, but will use the inbuild "Map" 
library. (And probably vectors)

* Go implementation will be a stand-alone package that can be imported for any software development practices.

* JAVA implementation rounds up the whole exercise which was to prove the point of "all languages though can have the same logic, may have different implementations due to the 'best practices' and other issues involved" and also lets me catch up with all the languages I am familiar with (Sorry python, Binary producers only).

* Code is extremely well documented putting down all the thought processes and reasons to any idea. (Inspired from Go github repos)

* Further plans would be to write rigorous and formal tests, that everyone can validate and have an easy way to test their own inputs too.

PS : Contributions, bugs found, better practices in the languages or any other things are all welcome! Just open an issue based on your concern :D
