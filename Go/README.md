# Implementation of LRU Cache in Go


* Clear and well documented code.
* Easy less dependency support.
* O(1) time operations.
* Usage of go.mod makes it easy for usage, just `import github.com/SUMUKHA-PK/LRU-Cache/Go` !

## File structure : 
 * Package linkedList contains the implementation of a rudimentary Doubly Linked List(DLL) and its tests for functionality.
 * Package main has the files for the LRU cache (lru.go) and its test for funtionality.
 * `types.go` has the struct of the LRUCache
